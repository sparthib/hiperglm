  # The `do.call` trick below might seem like a clever solution and a 
  # simpler-to-implement alternative to S3 methods. However, it tends to make 
  # the code less readable and harder to maintain. For example, you wouldn't 
  # know the exact function being called by `sprintf("calc_%s_loglik", model)` 
  # without reading other parts of code. It also obscures the usage of those 
  # functions within codebase; e.g. `git grep "calc_logit_grad"` would fail to 
  # detect its usage here. The trick is used here only for didactic/illustrative 
  # purpose --- I advise against its use in general.
